Our project, the "QIslam: An interactive Islamic learning platform," developed in C++(OOP) using the Qt framework,
aims to create an accessible and informative platform for learning about Islamic teachings. 
Featuring options like Quranic verses, Ashra e Mubashira history, prayers guide, and the 99 names of Allah,
the platform provides a user-friendly interface. The Hadith section is organized into eight classes,
each representing a book, with audio, images, and translations for an immersive experience.
The app also guides users through the proper method of Muslim prayers and fasting and ummrah.
This project emphasizes simplicity and interactivity to enhance understanding and engagement.
